In this paper, a dual-polarized reflectarray-based metasurface aperture (DPRMA) is proposed to perform computational polarimetric imaging (CPI) in the K-band (18–22 GHz). Firstly, a metallic bar is designed as metamaterial element whose geometrical features are varied on a random basis across the aperture. Bars with different lengths and rotation angles will produce different reflection amplitudes and phases under orthogonal polarizations, which helps to increase the degrees of freedom in generating low-correlated measurement modes for imaging. Then, a horn antenna positioned at 45◦ is used to excite the DPRMA. The reflection amplitudes and phases over the aperture vary randomly when excited at different frequencies, which enables the synthesis of frequency-dependent, quasi-random radiation patterns. As a result, performing a simple frequency sweep would introduce a significant variation of the aperture, which is an ideal condition required for coded-aperture-based CPI. Finally, the DPRMA based CPI experiment is implemented through CST simulations and the image of target L is reconstructed successfully. Comparison results under different polarimetric channels verify the feasibility of the proposed DPRMA as well as the advantage of the CPI. The design is validated by simulations.
