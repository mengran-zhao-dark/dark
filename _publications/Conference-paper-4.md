The test modes (uncorrelated complex radiation petterns), which are generated by the metamaterial aperture, have been widely used in the coincidence imaging system. However, the design of the metamaterial aperture and the requirement of the coincidence imaging are still disconnected theoretically. In this paper, we attempt to present the problems in the connection of the metamaterial aperture design and the coincidence imaging requirement. Firstly, the property of the metamaterial cells depends on the structure, which is hard to be modeled in the aperture design. Then, the physical constraints, which should be considered in the requirement of the coincidence imaging, are hard to be given. Finally, the number of the test modes that contained in the aperture is hard to evaluate in theory. We believe the presented problems can be solved in the next few years.
