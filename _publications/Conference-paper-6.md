In this paper, a wideband feeding network is proposed to match low-profile circularly polarized patch antennas (including the bandwidth of GPS and Beidou navigation system). By loading some metal posts, resonance frequency caused by the eigenmode is shifted to out of the occupied bandwidth. The feeding network consists of three Wilkinson power dividers. Every adjacent output port of the proposed feeding network has about 90Â° phase shifter in the occupied bandwidth, and the insertion loss of every port is about 0.5 dB. The gap between two substrates of feeding network should be well controlled in order to ensure the performance of the feeding network. Simulation and experiment results show that the relative bandwidth of the circularly polarized antenna loading this feeding network is about 37% for VSWR <2 and AR <3 dB from 1.164 to 1.64GHz.
