A broadband polarization-sensitive reflection metamaterial aperture (BPRMA) for coincidence imaging in terahertz band is proposed in this paper. The BPRMA consists of broadband polarization-sensitive metamaterial elements with different rotation directions. Firstly, the metamaterial element with cross-polarization conversion characteristic in terahertz band is designed and the broadband characteristic is achieved by sweeping the parameter W of the metamaterial element. Then, the BPRMA is designed via randomly distributing metamaterial elements with different rotation directions and different parameter Ws. The cross-polarization characteristic can be used to generate various measurement modes (i.e., the reflection patterns of the BPRMA) by altering the polarization angle of the incident plane wave. Finally, the reflection coefficients of the metamaterial element are presented, and the correlation coefficients of the reflection patterns generated from different polarized incident waves as well as from different frequencies are also studied. The design is validated through simulation results.
