A multi-domain joint designed transmission-reflection cavity metasurface antenna (TRCMA) that can generate diverse radiation patterns in both the frequency and the polarization domain is proposed in this paper. Capacity of measurement modes that can be used for coincidence imaging is enlarged significantly because of the multi-domain joint design. The TRCMA working from 75 GHz to 110 GHz contains a disordered cavity as the feeding module and several disparate metasurfaces holding distinguished transmission-reflection features as the modulation module. Electric field distributions of the disordered cavity vary from frequency to frequency due to the disturbance of irregular structures and the reflection of metasurfaces. The frequency-diverse characteristic of the disordered cavity would be inherited by the metasurfaces and finally passed on to radiation patterns. The propagation direction of the electromagnetic wave is random because of multiple reflections of irregular structures and therefore polarization statuses of the holes etched in the lid are diverse, which would lead to polarization-diverse radiation patterns. Performances of the proposed TRCMA including the reflection coefficient (S<sub>11</sub>), the radiation efficiency and correlation coefficients of radiation patterns generated at different frequencies as well as under orthogonal polarization statuses are evaluated. A simulated coincidence imaging experiment is also carried out using the proposed TRCMA and the target image is reconstructed successfully. The design is verified by simulated results.
