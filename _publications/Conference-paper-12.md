In recent decades, microwave imaging technology has been used in a variety of applications including security, medicine, nondestructive testing and structural health monitoring. Traditional microwave imaging systems often suffer from drawbacks such as long acquisition times and complex array structures. To address these issues, this paper introduces a panel-to-panel microwave computational imaging (CI) technique for near-field operation using dynamic metasurface antennas for both transmission and reception, enhancing system diversity and enabling real-time applications. The paper also outlines mathematical models for three-dimensional image reconstruction algorithms tailored to this scenario. The results of numerical and electromagnetic simulations show the feasibility of this approach for CI-based imaging, with both Fourier and least squares-based image reconstruction techniques.
