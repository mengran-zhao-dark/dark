In this paper, three types of stirrers are analyzed and compared in terms of the field uniformity in a reverberation chamber (RC). The first type (i.e., Type I) is a standard Z-type rotating mode stirrer consisting of four metal plates. The second type (i.e., Type II) is similar to the standard mode stirrer, yet with two plates rotating clockwise and the other two plates rotating counterclockwise. The third type (i.e., Type III) is a translating mode stirrer of a rectangular metal plate. For fair comparison, we make sure that the volumes swept by the three mode stirrers are the same. The field uniformity is used to compare the performances of the three mode stirrers. Then, a comparison of two stirrers' performances in a reverberation is carried out to get further verification. Our results show that mode stirrer Type I and II have almost the same performance whereas the mode stirrer Type III has the worst performance.
