A conical dielectric lens based frequency-diverse bunching meta material aperture (FDBMA) is proposed in this paper. The FDBMA consists of a frequency-diverse transmission meta material aperture (FDTMA) to produce different radiation patterns at different frequencies and a conical dielectric lens (CDL) to bunch the radiation patterns generated by the FDTMA. Firstly, the FDTMA that consists of a frequency-diverse metalens and a circular array is designed. Furthermore, a CDL is designed to bunch the radiation patterns generated by the FDTMA and the dip angle of the CDL is optimized. Finally, the reflection coefficient (i.e., S<sub>11</sub>), radiation efficiency and correlation coefficient of FDBMA were evaluated. The radiation patterns generated by the FDBMA can be used as a measurement pattern in accordance with coincidence imaging. All of the results are validated through simulation results.
