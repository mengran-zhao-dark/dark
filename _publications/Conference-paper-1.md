We proposed a metamaterial aperture antenna for computational imaging by using the metamaterial structure complementary electric-inductor-capacitor (cELC), which uses frequency diversity to avoid mechanical scanning. This aperture allows image compression to be performed on the physical hardware layer rather than in the processing stage, thus averting the cost of data storage associated with full diffraction-limited sampling of a scene. In this paper, we would show that the metamaterial aperture is fed using SMA adapter to obtain good matching and the aperture can generate random radiation patterns within the K band via randomly distributing metamaterials' resonance frequencies both in the simulation and the measurement.
